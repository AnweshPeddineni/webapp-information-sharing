                  information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as
                  a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user’s
                  individual interests using the identified computer. Unless you
                  voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for
                  example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if
                  we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal
                  information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an
                  example of this is when you ask for our Personalised

                  advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser
