                  I do thorough fundamental analysis of every company I buy,
                  while analysing companies I mostly use key ratios such as Debt
                  to Equity ratio, ROE (Return on equity), P/E (Price to
                  earnings), P/S (Price to sales) and others. I go through the
                  company’s recent financial statements including income
                  statement, Balance sheet and Cash flow statements. I will
                  check for competence and integrity of management. Along with
                  quantitative analysis I will also look at many qualitative
                  aspects of the company to find the value of a particular
                  company. And if I find that a company has improving business
                  fundamentals and if its forward looking value is considerably
                  higher than its current market price I may execute a buy.{" "}

                <li>
                  If I find a company with long lasting durable competitive
                  advantage I will consider investing in it irrespective of
                  whether it is a small company or a big company. I invest in
                  small-caps, mid-caps and also large-caps. I will constantly be
                  looking for Innovation and technology driven companies which
                  fit well in the modern world and also I keep looking for
                  companies with good products and services.{" "}

                  I will have 10 to 20 stocks in my portfolio, if I have high
                  conviction and clarity in a particular company’s growth I will
                  sometimes intensify my allocation in that company’s stock. If
                  I find an exceptionally good company I may do repeat buys even
                  at a higher purchase price than previously bought price.{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  I buy every company with a long term approach, but if its
                  fundamentals change in the middle or if the company’s market
                  price grows too fast to become overpriced I may book partial
                  profit or full profit in it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a company that I invested in has uncertain future
                  prospects, I will always exit such company at first sign of
                  trouble even at loss or profit. I will avoid catching a
                  falling knife, if a stock is going down continuously from last
                  2 to 3 years I will stay away from it as it can end up being a
                  value trap.{" "}

                  I started my investing journey in 2017, like every amateur
                  investor I also lost money in the beginning and stayed away
                  from investing in stocks for a while. I tried to learn from my
                  mistakes and started learning about investing by reading books
                  written by well-known investors like Benjamin Graham, Warren
                  Buffet, Peter Lynch etc… which gave me a good insight on how
                  to find and invest in good companies to grow money in the long
                  term and after getting a clarity about investing, by the end
                  of 2019 I started getting back to investing and had a
                  successful year 2020 with good returns which not only covered
                  my losses I have previously made but also made a good net
                  profit. I also started investing in US stocks through my
                  sister’s D mat account who stays in US from July 2020 and made
                  a return of – How ever now I opened my Vested account to
                  directly invest in US stocks from India in 2021.{" "}

                  My India portfolio has generated a return of 98% in the full
                  year 2020. And in the year 2021 year to date my portfolio has
                  generated a return of -- %{" "}

                  n investing money can be grown exponentially with time if a
                  consistent growth rate can be achieved every year. This
                  happens because of compounding. A onetime investment of Rs 5
                  Lakhs at a CAGR of 30% can grow in to Rs 2.55 Crores in a time
                  span of 15 years. (CAGR is Compounded Annual Growth Rate). My
                  objective is to produce a yearly return of 25 to 30% in my
                  portfolio.{" "}

                  The world is changing fast and that is happening because of
                  the solutions, products and services offered by companies
                  around the world. Majority of such companies are listed on
                  stock exchanges in different countries and people like you and
                  me can buy the shares of these companies. And owning some
                  shares of these companies is like buying a small piece in each
                  of these companies. When we identify and buy shares of a good
                  company which has an increasing intrinsic value because of
                  improving fundamentals the market will sooner or later
                  recognize it and the market price of the company starts rising
                  and when the market price of the company increases the share
                  price of the company increases, this grows the money we
                  invested.{" "}
